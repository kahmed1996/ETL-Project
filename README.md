# ETL-Project

We are attempting to combine Census demogaphic data with Cuyahoga county precinct-level turnout data to determine which demographic factors are correlated with increased likelihood to vote. To do this we will combine a csv from the County elections board, which has precinct-level data on which registered voters voted and who did not; with the US Census block-level and city-level data for the county. Block level data will be correlated with electoral precincts by use of the following Github project:

https://github.com/mggg/ohio-precincts

In case that is not workable we will endeavor to get data on which blocks are in which precincts from the County. If that does not work we will use city-level data for the suburbs.
The github pages can be accessed at https://kahmed1996.github.io/ETL-Project/
