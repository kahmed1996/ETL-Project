          <h4><b>Voter Turn-out Data</b></h4>
          <p>The raw voter turn-out data was pulled into a Pandas dataframe and a number of columns were dropped including voter personal information
            such as name and address, and primary election data as we felt general election data would be of more interest.  Election column blanks were then 
            populated with an "N" for data consistency.<br>
            <br>  
            A voter information only dataframe was created from this cleaned data and exported to a CSV file.<br>
            <br>
            The voter file and columns are as follows:
            <br> 
            <ul>
              <li>voters.csv:  voter_id_org, city, party, birth_date</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            It was determined that in order for the database to be most effective, a table containing a voter record for each election would be needed.
            to accomplish this, a dataframe was created for each of the 13 general election. Each was formatted by first adding an "election" column, then iterating through 
            and populating the specific election utilizing ".assign" Pandas attribute.  The original election column was then renamed to "voted" and the voter ID was made the index.
            All 13 cleaned election dataframes were then put into a variable and merged together consecutively using the Pandas ".concat" attribute, sorted by voter ID, then election
            and exported into a CSV.<br>
            <br>
            The elections file and columns are as follows:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>elections.csv:  voter_id, election, voted</li> 
            </ul>
          </p><br>

          <h4><b>Census Data</b></h4>
          <p>The raw census data was pulled into a pandas dataframe then filtered for only the data for
              Cuyahoga county.  The columns were then renamed to more meaningful names.  Mini dataframes were then created with 
              relative columns, all containing the census tract, and exported to .csv files to be loaded into relevent tables.<br>
              <br>
              The files and their relative columns are as follows:<br>
              <br> 
            <ul>
              <li>census_population.csv:  CensusTract, Total_Population</li>
              <li>census_gender.csv:  CensusTract, Men, Women</li>
              <li>census_ethnicity.csv:  CensusTract, Total_Population, Hispanic, White, Black, Native, Asian, Pacific</li>
              <li>census_income.csv:  CensusTract, Meadian_Houshold_Income, Income_Per_Capita, Under_Pov_Level_Perentage</li>
              <li>census_employment_type.csv:  CesnsusTract, Total_Employed, PrivateWork, PublicWork, SelfEmployed</li>
              <li>census_professions.csv:  CensusTract, Total_Employed, Professional_Workers_Percentage,
                Service_Workers_Percentage, Office_Workers_Percentage, Construction_Workers_Percentage, Production_Workers_Percentage</li>
            </ul>
          </p><br>

          <h4><b>City vs Census Tract Map</b></h4>
          <p>The map PDF was converted to CSV by manually typing the information into a working Excel spreadsheet, formating the data, then saving as a .csv.  The census tracts in the census data 
            are the tract numbers on the map preceded by the five-digit cuyahoga county code (39035).  This code was added to each record 
            in the excel working file, then concatenated with the tract number to create the correct census tract/s per city.  Tract numbers are all unique
            and cities may contain multiple tracts and are thus listed more than once in some instances.  each tract is a unique row with a corresponding
            city.<br>
            <br>
            The file and columns are as follows:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Census_City.csv:  CensusTract, City</li>
            </ul>  
          </p><br>
